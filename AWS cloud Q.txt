🚀 Clearing My LVM & Dynamic Storage Concepts After an Interview Question

I once asked this in an AWS cloud engineer interview.

Q: Your EKS pods are crashing with “out of memory” errors. How do you troubleshoot?

A: I’d check the pod’s resource limits in the deployment spec. If they’re too low or missing, I’d adjust CPU/memory requests and limits to match the workload.

Q: You launched an EC2 instance, but it’s stuck in the “pending” state. What’s going on?

A: Could be an unavailable AMI or instance type in the AZ. I’d check if the AMI exists and if the AZ supports the instance type.

Q: Your ALB is routing traffic unevenly across healthy targets. Why might that happen?

A: The ALB’s load balancing algorithm might be session-based. I’d check if sticky sessions are enabled or if cross-zone load balancing is off, causing uneven distribution.

Q: Your EKS cluster can’t scale new pods due to insufficient IPs. How do you resolve this?

A: The VPC’s CIDR block might be too small. I’d enable VPC CNI’s custom networking or add a secondary CIDR to increase the IP pool.

Q: You’re using AWS Secrets Manager, but your application can’t retrieve the secret. What’s wrong?

A: The app’s IAM role might lack “secretsmanager:GetSecretValue” permission, or the secret’s ARN is misconfigured in the code. I’d verify both.

Q: Your SQS queue is piling up messages, but your Lambda consumer isn’t processing them. Why?

A: The Lambda might not have an event source mapping to the SQS queue, or its IAM role lacks permission to read from the queue. I’d check both.

Q: You’re getting “ThrottlingException” errors from a DynamoDB table during peak traffic. How do you handle it?

A: I’d enable auto-scaling for the table’s read/write capacity or switch to on-demand mode to handle bursts without throttling.

Q: You enabled MFA for an IAM user, but they can still log in without it. Why?

A: The MFA policy might not be enforced. I’d ensure a policy requiring MFA is attached to the user or group and that it’s applied to the console login action.



Why the AWS DNS service is called Route 53 ? not a 43 or 63? 

Because DNS always uses port 53. amazon just added the word “route” in front of it to show it’s about directing internet traffic.

And, it is the only AWS service with 100% availability SLA.

fascinating.
